- **Exceptions**: Appropriate for system errors and unrecoverable failures
- **User Experience**: Result patterns provide better error messages for UI
- **System Reliability**: Exceptions ensure proper error propagation for infrastructure issues

### Guidelines
```csharp
// Use Result<T> for:
- Input validation errors
- Business rule violations  
- Configuration issues user can fix
- External service unavailable (temporary)

// Use Exceptions for:
- Database connection failures
- Authentication system failures
- Memory/resource exhaustion
- Programming errors (null reference, etc.)
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Clear error handling patterns
  - Better user experience for recoverable errors
  - Proper system error propagation
  - Consistent across codebase
- **Negative**:

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision Makers**: Core Development Team

### Context
We need a scalable, maintainable architecture that supports complex business logic, clear separation of concerns, and testability while handling both simple CRUD operations and complex workflows.

### Decision
Implement Clean Architecture with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) using the Mediator pattern for request handling.

### Architecture Components
- **[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)**: Domain-centric layered architecture
- **[CQRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)**: Separate read and write operations
- **[Mediator by martinothamar](https://github.com/martinothamar/Mediator)**: High-performance mediator implementation
- **[FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/)**: Declarative validation rules
- **Result Pattern**: Type-safe error handling with comprehensive error information

### Layer Structure
```
Domain Layer (_src/Domain/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Entities & Value Objects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain Services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Business Rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Interfaces (No external dependencies)

Application Layer (_src/Endpoints/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CQRS Commands & Queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Command/Query Handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation Rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Services

Infrastructure Layer (_src/Data/, _src/Gateway/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Entity Framework DbContext
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Repository Implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ External Service Integrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration & DI
```

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers prevent coupling
- **Testability**: Domain logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Scalability**: CQRS allows different optimization strategies for reads vs writes
- **Performance**: martinothamar/Mediator provides zero-allocation request dispatching
- **Maintainability**: FluentValidation keeps validation rules close to domain models
- **Error Handling**: Result pattern provides explicit, type-safe error handling

### Implementation Examples

**Command Pattern**:
```csharp
public record CreateMcpServerCommand(McpSimpleConfiguration Configuration) : ICommand<Result<McpServer>>;

public class CreateMcpServerCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<CreateMcpServerCommand, Result<McpServer>>
{
    // Validation, business logic, persistence
}
```

**Query Pattern**:
```csharp
public record GetMcpServersQuery(string UserId, string[] Roles) : IQuery<McpServer[]>;

public class GetMcpServersQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<GetMcpServersQuery, McpServer[]>
{
    // Optimized read operations
}
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Clear separation of concerns across layers
  - Highly testable architecture
